## Understanding APICS and its Certifications

APICS, now known as ASCM (Association for Supply Chain Management), is the leading provider of supply chain, manufacturing, and operations management research, education, and certification programs. Obtaining an APICS certification demonstrates your commitment to professional development and your expertise in these critical areas. The two most popular APICS certifications are:

Both certifications require passing an exam, and to prepare effectively, many professionals turn to online courses.
