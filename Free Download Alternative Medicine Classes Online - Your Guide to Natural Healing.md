## What is Alternative Medicine?

Alternative medicine, also known as complementary medicine or integrative medicine, involves medical treatments that are used *instead* of standard medical treatments. These practices often focus on holistic healing, addressing the mind, body, and spirit to achieve optimal health. The goal is often to empower individuals to take control of their well-being through natural and sustainable methods.

Common forms of alternative medicine include:

*   **Acupuncture:**  A traditional Chinese medicine technique involving the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate energy flow and promote healing.
*   **Herbal Medicine:**  Using plants and their extracts for medicinal purposes. It's one of the oldest forms of medicine, with a rich history in various cultures.
*   **Chiropractic Care:**  Focusing on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine.
*   **Yoga and Meditation:**  Practices that combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and mental focus to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.
*   **Homeopathy:**  A system of medicine based on the principle of "like cures like," using highly diluted substances to stimulate the body's self-healing abilities.
*   **Naturopathy:**  A holistic approach to health that emphasizes prevention and self-healing through natural therapies like nutrition, herbal medicine, and lifestyle changes.
*   **Massage Therapy:**  Using various manual techniques to manipulate soft tissues, relieving pain, reducing stress, and promoting relaxation.
*   **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM):**  A comprehensive system of medicine that includes acupuncture, herbal medicine, dietary therapy, and exercise (such as Tai Chi and Qigong) to balance the body's energy (Qi) and promote health.
